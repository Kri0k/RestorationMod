This mod adds for now two rusty tools: Meat Axe and Schiavonesca sword, which you can restore.

These items can be obtained by mining ore and killing zombies. There is a very low chance of getting them, but restored item is very good.

Also, this mod adds several custom items that will help you with the restoration:
- Grease
- Bolt
- Screwdriver
- Sandpaper
- Chisel

So for the first step of restoration you will need to combine screwdriver, greese and rusty item in a workbench. As a result you will get a rusty blade, which you need to put in a brewing stand in a potion slot. After that put a quartz in an ingredient slot and wait till the end of process. Now you have a patinated blade. To cleat it put it in a smithing table in the first slot, and sandpaper in a second. You will get a clean blade.
Now you should make a handle. To make it you will need a chisel and a wood or some metals/minerals (such as golden ingot, diamond, emerald) to be combined in a workbench. Now, if you made a metal handle, sand it in a smithing table, like it was with patinated blade.
To collect the tool, put in a workbench a bolt, screwdriver, and tool parts.

This mod is new so there will be more items to restore.
